### Installing required dependencies

The serial-to-usb bridge requires the `pyserial` library to function. Create a virtual environment with 

`python -m venv env`

then activate the environment with

`source env/Scripts/activate` (bash terminal)

then install required dependencies:

`pip install -r 'requirements.txt'`
